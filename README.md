Prediction of Mental Health Care Needs for an Employee using Pyspark

Project assignments of Big Data Course

ðŸ“Œ Created the best model that predicted which employees will need mental health care using the dataset Mental Health in Tech Survey from Kaggle 

ðŸ“Œ Used Pyspark with 7 different algorithms namely Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost then compares all of these algorithms to get the best accuracy in making predictions. 

ðŸ“Œ Utilized preprocessing and visualization techniques for the analysis of variables in the dataset.
